**A large number of language pairs are under low resource conditions due to insufficient official parallel data. Among all low resource language pairs, we selected English-Sinhala as our study target because of the current machine translation model's bad performance on it. In this assignment, we applied some methods to improve the BLEU score of English-Sinhala translation, including data cleaning, adding domain tags, and multilingual training. Then we dug into a specific problem we ran into, made assumptions, and set up some experiments to prove it.**
