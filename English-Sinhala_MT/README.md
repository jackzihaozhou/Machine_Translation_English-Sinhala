**A large amount of language pairs are under low resource condition due to the insufficient official parallel data. Among all low resource language pairs, we selected English-Sinhala as our study target because of current machine translation model's bad performance on it. In this assignment, we applied some methods to improve the BLEU score of English-Sinhala translation, including data cleaning, adding domain tags and multilingual training. Then we dug into a specific problem we ran into, made assumption and set up some experiments to prove it.**
